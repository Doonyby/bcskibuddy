					<h2>Back Country Ski Buddy Info.</h2><hr>
					<p>Here at Back Country Ski Buddy, the enjoyment of the amazing backcountry opportunities that Utah has to offer is our primary goal.  The Utah back country offers steep slopes, instant/easy accessibility, and the best snow on earth, but all of this comes with a high price of sparatic and constant avalanche conditions.  Becoming educated on signs and conditions of avalanche danger is essential when stepping out into the mountain environment during the winter season.  However, education is a very small part of avalanche safety when it comes to protecting your life.  We are all subject to mistakes, bad decisions, and unknown snow conditions that can get us into trouble.  This is why the other absolutely necessary part to back country travel is having companions with you who can assist in group decisions, and in a rescue if needs be.  Don't go alone!!!!  Having companions with you, who possess a beacon, shovel, probe, and the knowledge to use them, are invaluable to you as you are to them.</p><br>
					<p>This site is designed to make it easier to find those companions who can add to the safety of your back country use, and give you the peace of mind you need to fully enjoy the powder and terrain.  You can create tour dates, view tours that others have organized, and join those tours if desired.  This is all done by location to enable not only local community to join together, but to enable you to tour around in other locations and still find companions to practice good safety standards.  After organizing or joining for a specific tour, as the tour date approaches, make sure to click available links to the <a target="_blank" href="https://utahavalanchecenter.org">https://utahavalanchecenter.org</a> and check out the avalanche advisories and snow conditions for that specific location.</p><br>
					<p>Have fun out there, and use the incredible Utah backyard that we share in a safe way to maximize your experience.</p>
